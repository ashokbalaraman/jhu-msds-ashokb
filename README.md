# Revolutionizing Cyber Threat Hunting: The Emergence of LLM in AI-Driven Cybersecurity


## Abstract
This paper explores the evolution of threat hunting in cybersecurity, from manual analysis to the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI). We highlight the shift towards machine learning in detecting cyber threats and introduce LLMs as a novel approach for advanced threat analysis. Our study presents a dual perspective: utilizing LLMs to enhance threat hunting and examining their potential as vectors for cyber threats. Through simulated cybersecurity environments, we demonstrate LLMs' capability to process and analyze complex security data, aiding in the identification of sophisticated threats. Our findings reveal LLMs' significant contributions to improving threat detection accuracy and efficiency, while also addressing the challenges and ethical considerations of their application in cybersecurity. This research underscores the potential of LLMs in transforming cyber defense mechanisms, marking a new era in the fight against evolving cyber threats.

In this research, we delve into the enhancement of threat detection systems by employing the Mordor dataset, meticulously categorized according to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which delineates an extensive array of adversarial tactics and techniques. The Mordor dataset, renowned for its compilation of realistic and detailed cybersecurity event logs from simulated adversarial activities, serves as the cornerstone of our analysis. These simulations are crafted to mirror sophisticated real-world cyber threats, providing a rich tapestry of data that encapsulates the complexity and diversity of modern cyber attacks.

Our methodology involves a two-pronged approach: Firstly, we apply advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms to the Mordor dataset to identify patterns and anomalies indicative of malicious activities. This process is informed by the MITRE ATT&CK framework, ensuring that our analysis remains aligned with recognized adversarial behaviors. Secondly, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret the contextual nuances within the dataset, enhancing our ability to discern the subtleties of complex attack vectors.

The integration of these approaches allows us to not only detect known threats with greater accuracy but also to uncover novel attack strategies that evade traditional detection systems. Preliminary results indicate a significant improvement in the detection of sophisticated multi-stage attacks, underscoring the potential of our methodology to bolster cybersecurity defenses.

This research contributes to the cybersecurity field by demonstrating the efficacy of combining structured threat data with advanced analytical techniques. By harnessing the depth of the Mordor dataset within the framework of MITRE ATT&CK, we pave the way for the development of more adaptive, intelligent, and efficient threat detection systems.
